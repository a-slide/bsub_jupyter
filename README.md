# bsub_jupyter
------------

Connect to a LSF head node run a jupyter notebook via bsub and automatically open a double ssh tunnel to forward the interface on localhost.

##Dependencies

The program was tested under Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and requires the following dependencies on your local machine:

* Python 2.7
* OpenSSH 5.4+

in addition, the head node of your LSF file system requires the following dependencies as well :
* Python 2.7
* OpenSSH 5.4+
* Jupyter 4.0.0+

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/a-slide/bsub_jupyter.git
cd bsub_jupyter
chmod u+x bsub_jupyter.py
```

Then add bsub_jupyter.py to your PATH

## Add public key to the machine

To avoid entering the password many many times to establish the connection those steps are necessary, BEFORE running the script.

Create a new ssh key if you donâ€™t have one with the command

```
ssh-keygen
```
The key will be stored by default in: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

Install the utility ssh-copy-id if not available. 

While inside your network (or connected through the VPN) copy your public key to the main node machine with the command:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub lp698@ssh.research.partners.org
```

## Usage
```
bsub_jupyter.py [-h] -U SSH_USERNAME -H SSH_HOSTNAME [-p REMOTE_PATH]   [-m MEMORY] [-t THREADS] [-q QUEUE] [-l LOCAL_PORT]  [-r REMOTE_PORT] [-v]
```

For example:
```
bsub_jupyter.py -U luke -H hh-yoda-04-01.ebi.ac.uk -p /nfs/leia/data/ -m 10000 -t 5 -q darkside -l 9999 -r 9998 --verbose
```

In verbose mode you will see:

Tunnel created! You can see your jupyter notebook server at:

	--> http://localhost:9999 <--

Press Ctrl-c to interrupt the connection
Warning: Permanently added 'hh-yoda-11-13.ebi.ac.uk' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

```

Now you can open a browser and connect to the url provided, in this case http://localhost:9999 (if not given the local and remote ports are generated at random between 9000 and 10000 to minimize conflicts with other users)

Once finished you can press Ctrl+c. The ssh tunnel and the job will be automatically killed

```
Connection interupted by user
Try to remove the connection file and kill the existing jupyter job...
Job <4849305> is being terminated
```

Options are described in the command line help:

```
bsub_jupyter.py --help
```

```
usage: bsub_jupyter.py [-h] -U SSH_USERNAME -H SSH_HOSTNAME [-p REMOTE_PATH]

                       [-r REMOTE_PORT] [-v]

Connect to a LSF main node directly or trough a ssh jump node launch a jupyter
notebook via bsub and open automatically a tunnel.
